// If you want to develop the UI on your local machine
// you have to run the Backend and make the calls to 'localhost: 8080'
// So just comment the production domain and uncomment the local domain



// export const DOMAIN = "http://localhost:8080/";

// When it comes to deployment you must commit changes with the production domain to the master branch



export const DOMAIN = "https://logistics-engine.herokuapp.com/";
